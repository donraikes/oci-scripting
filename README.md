# oci-scripting
oci infrastructure as code scripts

This repository contains the ansible and terraform scripts I have developed to manage a sample Oracle Cloud tenancy.

These scripts are designed to be a starting point for more detailed production scripts.
These scripts are being written as I learn both ansible and terraform.

## Setup:

My tenancy has 2 compartments:

-	root

-	lab (where I will be creating all my objects)

All objects will be in the public subnet.
